# My Personal blog
My personal blog site, built with the Hugo static site generator, HTML and pure CSS.

This was a personal project to learn the Hugo static site Generator and improve on my HTML and CSS without using any libraries.

After completing the project I wanted to make the site live so went through with hosting on Github pages(for the first time).

My final step was to use TravisCI for continuous integration to make updates as simple as pushing to the repo!

## Throughout the project I learnt.

* The Hugo templating syntax.
* How to utilize and manipulate page and site params in the HTML.
* Deploy and host a site on Github pages.
* How to set up and use Github submodules.
* Utilize TravisCI for ease of updates.
